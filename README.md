German Rhyme Corpus 

This is a diachronically balanced sample of German poetry, manually annotated on rhyme. 

It is notable that almost 1/3 of stanzas do not rhyme at all, which is often overlooked when building a rhyming corpus (the tendency of a stanza to rhyme depends heavily on the stanza length).

The corpus is in TEI P5 which can be validated with a relaxNG schema that you'll find in the 'Schema' folder.

It's format is based on the conventions used in the German Text Archive (deutschestextarchiv.de).
